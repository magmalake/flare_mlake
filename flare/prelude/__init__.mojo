"""``flare.prelude`` -- the everyday surface, in one import.

    from flare.prelude import *

Exports exactly what the root :mod:`flare` package exports, covering
the server, client, routing, handlers and extractors, middleware, TLS,
sockets, WebSocket and the test client. One list, so there is no second
one to keep in sync.

**What is on the list.** A symbol belongs here if either:

1. another listed symbol's signature names it -- the *closure rule*, so
   anything you can reach you can also write down; or
2. the README's basic or intermediate examples need it.

**What never is:** wire-format codecs, anything in a ``_``-prefixed
module, ``flare.runtime`` primitives, protocol-specific types beyond
their configuration structs, and test helpers other than
``TestClient``.

The closure rule is what v0.11 added, after seven symbols were found to
break it: ``precompute_response`` returned a ``StaticResponse`` callers
could not name, ``Cache[Inner, S]`` needed a store they could not name,
``UnixListener`` / ``UnixStream`` were absent while their TCP peers and
the frame-mux codec layered over them were both present, the WebSocket
handler's argument type was absent, and the README documented
``HandlerInfallible`` that neither barrel exported.

**Changed in v0.10 (breaking).** This used to re-export every stable
public symbol in the library -- 454 of them, including protocol
codecs like ``quic_encode_varint``, ``h2_encode_frame``,
``qpack_encode_field_section``, ``huffman_encode`` and
``encode_grpc_message``. A prelude that wide is not a convenience:
it puts wire-format internals one ``import *`` away from application
code, and it means every name flare adds anywhere becomes a name that
can collide in a user's module.

Anything not here still has a home; import it from the submodule that
owns it::

    from flare.http2 import Http2Connection, HpackEncoder
    from flare.quic import quic_encode_varint
    from flare.http3 import encode_http3_frame
    from flare.qpack import qpack_encode_field_section
    from flare.grpc import GrpcClient, encode_grpc_message
    from flare.runtime import Reactor, BufferPool
    from flare.crypto import hmac_sha256
    from flare.openapi import OpenApiSpec
    from flare.testing import TestClient

That is also the better habit in code meant to last:
``from flare.runtime import Reactor`` says where ``Reactor`` comes
from, and ``from flare.prelude import *`` does not.

``tests/test_prelude_surface.mojo`` pins this list against the root
package, so the two cannot drift and the surface cannot quietly
regrow.
