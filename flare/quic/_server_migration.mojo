"""Server-side connection-migration support helpers.

Carved out of :mod:`flare.quic.server` to keep the listener under the
1k-line budget and to isolate the path-validation + anti-amplification
policy in one auditable place.

When a 1-RTT packet for a known connection arrives from a *new* source
address (a NAT rebind or an explicit client ``migrate()``), RFC 9000
sec 9 requires the server to validate the new path before trusting it.
flare's listener implements a **strict egress hold**: it does NOT
follow the new address for general egress until the path validates.

* It keeps every non-probe 1-RTT egress (ACKs, H3 response STREAM
  frames) on the previously validated address; the candidate is
  promoted to the egress address only once the client echoes the
  server's ``PATH_CHALLENGE``
  (:meth:`flare.quic.server.QuicListener._process_one_packet`).
* It sends a server-initiated ``PATH_CHALLENGE`` (RFC 9000 sec 8.2) to
  the candidate; the client's matching ``PATH_RESPONSE`` flips the
  connection's ``path_validated`` event and releases the hold.
* Probe / echo egress to the unvalidated candidate is bounded at
  ``3x`` the bytes received from it (RFC 9000 sec 8.1 / sec 21.5.4
  anti-amplification), charged per *protected datagram* (not just the
  frame) in :meth:`QuicListener._drain_migration_probe`, so a
  spoofed-source migration cannot turn the server into a reflection
  amplifier. When the budget is exhausted the probe is held back and
  retried once more bytes arrive on the path.

The budget is seeded from the migration-triggering datagram
and grows with each received datagram on the candidate. The hold trades
a round trip of added latency on a genuine migration (the response to
the migrating request waits for validation) for the guarantee that no
1-RTT egress ever reflects off the server to an unvalidated address --
the security property the strict hold exists to provide.
