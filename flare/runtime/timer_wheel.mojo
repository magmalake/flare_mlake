"""Hashed timing wheel for the flare reactor.

Manages per-connection timeouts in user space, independent of the kernel.
We manage timeouts here (rather than via ``SO_RCVTIMEO`` /
``SO_SNDTIMEO`` on sockets) because a non-blocking reactor integrates
cleaner with a single shared monotonic clock than with many per-socket
options, and because per-fd timer fd registration would explode fd usage
on large connection counts.

Design:
- **Single-level wheel, 512 slots, 1 ms per slot.** Covers any timeout up
  to ~512 ms in the wheel itself; longer timeouts go to an overflow list
  and get "promoted" into the wheel on each advance.
- **O(1) schedule** into the wheel slot or the overflow list.
- **O(1) cancel** (mark as inactive in a dict; physical removal on fire).
- **O(k) advance** where k = number of slots to traverse plus overflow
  entries to promote. In practice k is 1-2 per millisecond in a steady
  state.

Usage::

    from flare.runtime import TimerWheel
    var tw = TimerWheel(now_ms=monotonic_ms())

    var tid = tw.schedule(after_ms=500, token=UInt64(0x1234))
    # ... later ...
    _ = tw.cancel(tid)

    # On every reactor iteration:
    var fired = List[UInt64]()
    tw.advance(monotonic_ms(), fired)
    # dispatch each token in `fired` as a timeout
