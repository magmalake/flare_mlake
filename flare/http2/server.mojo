"""HTTP/2 server glue (RFC 9113).

Connects :mod:`flare.http2.frame` + :mod:`flare.http2.hpack` +
:mod:`flare.http2.state` to flare's existing ``Handler`` interface.

The high-level surface:

- :class:`Http2Connection` — a synchronous, buffer-driven driver. The
  caller feeds it inbound bytes (``feed``) and pulls outbound bytes
  (``drain``). When a stream's request is complete, :meth:`take_request`
  yields a :class:`flare.http.Request` ready for a normal Handler.
  After the handler produces a :class:`flare.http.Response`,
  :meth:`emit_response` schedules the appropriate ``HEADERS [+ DATA]``
  frames.

- :func:`detect_h2c_upgrade` — sniff an inbound HTTP/1.1 request for
  ``Connection: Upgrade, HTTP2-Settings`` + ``Upgrade: h2c`` and
  return ``True`` when the connection should switch protocols. The
  caller is responsible for emitting the 101 response and then
  driving the connection through :class:`Http2Connection`.

- :func:`is_h2_alpn` — string match for ``"h2"`` so TLS code paths
  can dispatch from ALPN.

This is enough to ship a working server today while preserving the
plumbing for a future async / reactor integration: the driver does
not own its sockets, so the same code works in a unit test that
shoves bytes through it directly *and* in the reactor's per-fd
callback.
