"""Typed network errors for flare.

Every error type implements ``Writable`` so it can be
used with ``print()`` and ``String()``. All types also implement ``Copyable``
and ``Movable`` because errors are often returned from functions, stored in
Result types, or logged.

Design principle: every error instance carries enough context to understand
the failure without a stack trace. Include the peer address, hostname, or
port wherever relevant.
