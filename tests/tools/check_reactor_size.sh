#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/tools/check_reactor_size.sh -- enforce file-size discipline across the
# library, with a tight bar on the reactor sub-packages and a looser
# regression bar on the rest.
#
# Two passes run:
#
#   Pass A (600 lines): ``flare/http/_reactor`` + ``flare/http/_server``.
#     After the v0.8 reactor decomposition every file in these
#     sub-packages should fit in a reviewer's working memory; anything
#     bigger means the next refactor missed a natural seam and the
#     duplication / divergence pressure the decomposition undid is
#     creeping back.
#
#   Pass B (1000 lines): ``flare/quic`` ``flare/runtime`` ``flare/net``
#     ``flare/http2`` ``flare/http``. The v0.8 §1 structural-debt pass
#     brought every oversized module under 1000 lines (or onto the
#     allowlist); this pass guards against regressions.
#
# Usage: ``pixi run check-reactor-size`` (wired in pixi.toml).
#
# Thresholds:
#   FLARE_REACTOR_MAX_LINES (Pass A; default 600).
#   Pass B is fixed at 1000.
#
# ALLOWLIST policy (both passes):
#   Files in an allowlist are tracked + reported but do not fail the
#   lint. Every entry MUST carry a dated ``# TODO(YYYY-MM-DD ...)``
#   comment in the allowlisted source file referencing the planned
#   decomposition; the lint checks for the marker and promotes an
#   undated entry back to a hard violation. An entry leaves the list by
#   being split below the threshold. Allowlisted today: the monolith
#   structs Mojo cannot split across files (``HttpServer``,
#   ``QuicListener``) plus the in-flight ``conn_handle`` split.
#
# Exit code 0 = clean (every file under its threshold or on the matching
# allowlist), non-zero = at least one file is over threshold and not
# allowlisted.
