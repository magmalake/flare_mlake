# Build and run the per-area aggregate test binaries, then the handful of
# tests that must stay in their own process.
#
# The `tests` task runs one `mojo -I .` per test file. Measured on CI that
# is ~9s per invocation across 274 of them, and the cost is dominated by
# re-elaborating an ~90k-line source graph rather than by the test bodies:
# one file measured 1.70s to compile and 0.31s to run. Aggregating an
# area into a single binary pays the elaboration once per area.
#
# Locally, `tests/http` (110 files, 1229 tests) builds in ~72s and runs in
# ~15s as one binary.
#
# Aggregates are generated -- see tools/gen_test_aggregates.py. `--check`
# below is the drift gate: an aggregate that is out of date with the tree
# silently stops running whatever was added, and because an aggregate with
# no registered tests still exits 0, nothing downstream would notice.
