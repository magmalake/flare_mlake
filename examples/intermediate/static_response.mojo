"""Example 21 — Pre-encoded literal responses via ``serve_static``.

``HttpServer.serve_static(resp)`` is the fastest path flare offers:
the reactor parses every request only far enough to find the
``\\r\\n\\r\\n`` terminator and honour Content-Length, then ``memcpy``s
a pre-encoded response buffer into the write queue. No ``Request``
struct, no handler call, no response serialisation per request.

Intended for TFB plaintext and other workloads where the body is
genuinely fixed. This example builds the same wire-form bytes as the
TFB plaintext spec:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 13
    Connection: keep-alive (or close, chosen by the reactor)

    Hello, World!

The example prints the byte layout and declares the port the server
would bind to; it does **not** actually run the reactor loop (that
would block the test runner). For a live benchmark harness see
``benchmark/baselines/flare/`` and the TFB plaintext shape.

Run:
    pixi run example-static-response
